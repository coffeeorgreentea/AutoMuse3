Brief but lush scene description:

==========

The coffee shop is a small, cozy place with dark wood floors and big, comfortable chairs. The walls are lined with shelves full of books, and the air is thick with the smell of coffee and pastries.

The three friends are sitting at a table near the window, laughing and talking animatedly. The sun is streaming in through the window, casting a warm glow on their faces. The coffee cups in front of them are half-empty, and the plate of pastries is nearly gone.
