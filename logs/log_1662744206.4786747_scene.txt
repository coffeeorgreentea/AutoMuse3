SCENE: The coffee shop is small and cozy, with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The walls are lined with shelves full of books, and the tables are made of dark wood. The three friends sit at a table near the window, chatting and laughing as they enjoy their coffee. The sun is shining in through the window, casting a warm glow on the scene.
