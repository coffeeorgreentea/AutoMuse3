SCENE: The small, cozy coffee shop is filled with the warm and inviting atmosphere of close friends catching up. Laughter and conversation flow easily as the three sit around a dark wood table near the sun-filled window. Sasha Poskova breaks the news that she's been having trouble with her writing as of late, and both Jane and Ahmed offer their support and encouragement. Sasha decides to take a break from writing for a little while, and the three friends toast to better days ahead.
